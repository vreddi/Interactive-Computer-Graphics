README FILE FOR CS 418 'Dancing - I'
--------------------------------



COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

This app/project is build on Microsoft VS. 


INTERACTIVITY FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------
(note: All of these interactable features with the model are toggable mapped unique keys for each functionality
       to be separate from the other and run independently.) 
[The Instructions for the following functionalities is shown on the console screen.]

* Mesh-View ON/OFF

This functionality allows the User to interact with the model and toggle views between the wire or the 
mesh view of the 'I' and the solid color view of the 'I'. The mesh view can be used to ensure that there 
are no T-Junctions in the model.


* FPS Display ON/OFF

This functionality allows the user to view the FPS (frames per second) every second on the console screen.The target FPS set
for this application is 30fps.

* Dance ON/OFF

This functionality provides a 'Wiggle' animation to the model 'I'. This is too complete the animation/dancing requirement for the 
machine problem.This function is toggable and once its turned OFF the position of the model is reset as before. This is basically
acheived with the used of periodic functions such as a Sine Function.
[NOTE: For the animation FPS check, this is the main animation which should be used to check the FPS drop. Other animation along 
with this animation could produce a higher drop to ~27.5. Therefore it is added as an extra animation. THose could too be tested
for FPS if run individually. This should be noted for FPS Unit Grading.]
